PoC RAT using the [sneaky-creeper](https://github.com/DakotaNelson/sneaky-creeper/) data exfiltration library.

Not meant to be full-featured, just a fun project to write, and a proof-of-concept/example for anyone who wants to use sneaky-creeper.

If you get annoying `InsecurePlatformWarning` errors, run `pip install 'requests[security]'`.
